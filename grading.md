The ChemE 486 Design II course is largely structured around the AIChE Student Design Competition. As such, all of your assignments will be building towards your final submission in the form of a Final Report. As we are bound to adhere to the competition rules, we are limited in the content and feedback we can delivery. In particular, these two rules apply:

*Chemical Engineering Departments, including advisors, faculty, or any other instructors cannot provide technical aid specifically directed at the solution of the AIChE Student Design Competition if students plan on submitting to the contest. For example, if the problem statement asks for students to design a hydrogen production process, faculty members should not be directly telling students how to design this process or suggesting to them which process to use.*

*Students are permitted to ask generalized questions to faculty members and outside experts while working on this problem. For example, if students are designing a hydrogen production process and they have two production methods in mind, students may ask a faculty member with experience in hydrogen production about their experiences with the different methods so they can make an informed decision on which method to choose for their design. Students are also permitted to ask for assistance on how to use the process simulation software.*

As feedback in the form of a graded rubric would potentially violate these rules, homework assignments will be graded for completeness only: that all deliverables asked for are present, and a good-faith effort has been made for each component. Final projects and presentations, which will be turned in on the last day of the allotted 60-day period, will be graded on a rubric for both completeness and technical content, as outlined in the problem statement.

With the exception of the Reflections and Safety Moment assignments, all assignments and projects will be graded as a team effort.

Links to the grade breakdown for each assignment can be found at the provided links above.

*Note*: As this class will have specific software requirements, please let me know if this will be an issue for you. Note that all students have access to Aspen and Visio through their [RemoteApp cluster](https://www.engr.washington.edu/mycoe/computing/studentresources/remoteapp.html). The chemical engineering department also has computers available to students on the 1st floor computer lab. Please contact our computing and technology manager, Jessie Chiem (jchiem@uw.edu) for any questions or assistance.

## Guest Speaker Reflections

This course will include up to 5 guest speakers to provide context for process design from both industry and government. Each speaker has taken time out of their day job to attend, and we **expect you to show respect by showing up.** Not only will the information provided by the speakers be relevant to your final designs, but they will also potentially help give guidance to your careers as engineers.

Students will submit a one-page reflection on guest speaker presentation. These are open-ended, but questions you may want to consider are:

* What aspects of the speaker's talk will prove helpful in our design project?
* What aspects helped me understand potential careers for engineers?
* What questions do I still have on the topic covered?

## Project Updates

Each week in quiz section, project teams will be expected to give a 3-5 minute informal project update to their section TA. These project updates need not take much advanced preparation. Team members should rotate who presents from week to week. The following components should be present in the form of a Powerpoint slide:

1. An updated Gantt chart or other task management system.
2. Tasks completed during the previous week.
3. Unexpected hurdles encountered and potential resolutions.
4. Short-term (what to accomplish by next week) and long-term plans (tasks saved for later)

Students are not obligated to use Gantt charts for project management, but they must have a formal platform to allocate tasks and keep track of milestones (e.g. KanBan boards and GitHub issues from last quarter). There is some really cool software with a free version over at [TeamGantt](https://www.teamgantt.com/) that even interfaces with Slack, or you could go the traditional Excel spreadsheet route. There are some cool tools over at [Office Timeline](https://www.officetimeline.com/make-gantt-chart/excel#tutorial-auto) that you could consider using.

## Safety Moments

Individual students will present on Safety Moment each day in lecture and in each quiz section. Students can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMZrunPzMAjKA5XZ0oxcciD0_SN-1uZWSY5xc4Dmk_E/edit?usp=sharing).

A Safety Moment is a quick two-minute presentation on some aspect of safety in the context of design. This is largely open-ended, but potential topics may be drawn from the provided "AIChE Ammonia Safety Symposium: 50 Years of Shared Experiences", Safety Data Sheets, the SAChE website, or Chapter 26 of Turton.

## Literature Review

In order to help get you familiar with some of the literature provided to you in the problem statement, each team will provide a 5-7 minute review of one of the provided documents. Please donâ€™t select documents that have already been chosen by another group. Presentations will take place in class on Friday April 10 and Monday April 13. Students can sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMZrunPzMAjKA5XZ0oxcciD0_SN-1uZWSY5xc4Dmk_E/edit?usp=sharing).

Not everyone in the team has to present, but should be involved in the literature search. Things to include are:

* What is the venue/format of the document (encyclopedia entry, journal article, commercial website, etc)
* What particular aspect of design does this source address? (Separations, reactions, safety, risk, economics, etc)
* What are the major findings? What parts are useful for addressing the problem statement?


## Late Work

Late assignments will be penalized by 10% for the first 0-24 hours and 10% for each additional day (including weekends and holidays).

## Project Teams

Class projects will be completed in teams of 4. Teams will be assigned semi-randomly: students can select one teammate they would like to work with. Complete 4-person teams will then be formed by randomly pairing these two-person sub-teams. Students can specify their preferred partners for teams [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xMZrunPzMAjKA5XZ0oxcciD0_SN-1uZWSY5xc4Dmk_E/edit?usp=sharing). If you foresee any problems with your team after team assignment, please come see Prof. Stuve or Prof. Curtis.

Example designs are provided in the CD accompanying the textbook, [Appendix B](https://github.com/uw-cheme485/uw-cheme485.github.io/raw/master/lectures/example_designs.pdf) (also used in your homeworks). These are to be used only as a starting point, as the AIChE Design Problem is much more comprehensive. The PFDs, stream tables, and equipment summaries are good templates of what to aim for though. Rubrics for the final report and presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/uw-cheme486/uw-cheme486.github.io/raw/master/rubrics/486_Final_Project_Rubric.doc) and [here](https://github.com/uw-cheme486/uw-cheme486.github.io/raw/master/rubrics/486_Presentation_Rubric.doc), respectively.

Final projects will be graded as a group effort. Students will be able to give input on team member contributions through a team evaluation survey. Team members will be given 100 points to allot among all team members e.g. if you think all team members contributed equally and you are in a team of 3, you would give each team member 33.3 points.

In order to ensure consistent grading of final projects, the teaching team (all TAs and the instructors) will grade all reports together as a group.

Students are **not obligated** to participate in the AIChE Student Design Competition. With arrangement from the instructors students can either (1) work on the same design problem as the rest of the students with no expectation to submit or (2) choose an alternate design problem. Students will still be evaluated based on the same criteria as specified in the assignment rubrics. Students will also still be held to the same standard for asking for help on the problem.
