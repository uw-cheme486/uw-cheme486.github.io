## Course Design

Process Design II is a project-based course designed around the AIChE Chemical Engineering Design Competition. Students will be preparing a completed design report, including process flow diagrams, equipment cost and fixed capital investment summaries, process safety considerations, environmental considerations, manufacturing costs, and economic analyses. Students and faculty must adhere to the competition rules, as outlined in the provided documents. In particular, all designs **must be completed within 60 days of being assigned**, and **faculty members can only provided generalized advice and information not specific to the problem at hand**. Please see the grading page for any questions regarding the impact on assignments and evaluation.

## Course Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to design and optimize a chemical process plant with the following components:

1. Market analysis for a chemical product.
2. Estimates of chemical process equipment costs, fixed costs, variable costs, and total capital costs.
3. Economic analysis of net present value and other related measures of profitability.
4. Set of design and operating variables that optimize the chemical process plant design subject to various measures of profitability.
5. Preliminary, base case, and optimized chemical process designs.

## Note on Course Modifications for COVID-19

We have transitioned all content delivery, homework assignments, and communication with the instructional team online. All lectures and quiz sections will be held via Zoom. Links will be provided on the course schedule. Office hours will likely also be held via Zoom. Homework assignments will be delivered via Canvas. We have also set up a course Slack channel. We are generally very responsive through this mode of communication, and we recommend taking full advantage of it to ask questions, communicate with team members, give feedback, etc. You will receive an invitation link prior to the first day of class.

We are confirming with guest speakers whether they can still delivery their lectures via Zoom. We will update you as we get confirmations.  

## Conduct

The University of Washington Student Conduct Code (WAC 478-121) defines prohibited academic and behavioral conduct and describes how the University holds students accountable by students as they pursue their academic goals. In particular, please review the definitions of academic misconduct found [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH209.html#7) and [here](http://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/SGP/SPCH210.html#7). In the context of ChemE 486, it is expected that all work, homework and otherwise, is the students' own work for individual assignments, and the work of the group for team assignments. Concerns about these or other behaviors prohibited by the Student Conduct Code will be referred for investigation and adjudication by the College of Engineering.

Students found to have engaged in academic misconduct may receive a zero on the assignment (or other possible outcome).

## Access and Accommodations

Your experience in this class is important to both us as a teaching team. If you have already established accommodations with Disability Resources for Students (DRS), please communicate your approved accommodations to me as early as possible so we can discuss your needs in this course.

If you have not yet established services through DRS, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but not limited to mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical, or health impacts) you are welcome to contact DRS at 206-543-8924 or uwdrs@uw.edu or disability.uw.edu. DRS offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interaction process with you, your instructor(s) and DRS. It is the policy and practice of the University of Washington to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with state and federal law.

## Religious Accommodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UW's policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/) available on this site.
